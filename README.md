# Animal Trading Card

This is my first project in the Front End Web Development nanodegree at Udacity. Reviewed and approved fall 2017.

My task has been to re-create a webpage from a design prototype and some starter HTML. The design prototype is inspired by trading cards.

### How to run the application
You can run the application in your browser by either clicking this [link](https://littlepadawan.github.io/animal-trading-card/) or downloading the repository and opening `index.html` in your browser.
